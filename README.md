## Installation

> As this is a fork to make sure that the package is compatible with Laravel 12, I am not publishing this to composer

In your app's composer.json
```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/<your-username>/pulse-panphp"
    }
]
```
and run 
```
composer require raveltan/pulse-panphp:dev-main
```

## Usage

## Add to your dashboard

To add the card to the Pulse dashboard, you must first [publish the vendor view](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pulse#dashboard-customization).

Then, you can modify the `dashboard.blade.php` file:

```diff
<x-pulse>
+    <livewire:pulse.panphp cols='6' />

    <livewire:pulse.servers cols="full" />

    <livewire:pulse.usage cols="4" rows="2" />

    <livewire:pulse.queues cols="4" />

    <livewire:pulse.cache cols="4" />

    <livewire:pulse.slow-queries cols="8" />

    <livewire:pulse.exceptions cols="6" />

    <livewire:pulse.slow-requests cols="6" />

    <livewire:pulse.slow-jobs cols="6" />

    <livewire:pulse.slow-outgoing-requests cols="6" />

</x-pulse>
```
